<h3> Tracks </h3>
<p>Recently I have explored the concept of soundtracks. Building effectively soundtracks that emanate certain emotions, with arcs that accompany a story. My most recent work is based on the sentiment around war, fear and what it can do to small communities.</p>

<h4> These are my two most recent and currently favourite tracks linked below: </h4>

<h3> Music </h3>
<hr>
<p>
  I first began my endeavor into music composition and Technology in March of 2020. Through Lockdown I began to pick up guitar again, something I had started and stopped at the age of 10 years.This was my entrance into music composition and through this I gained a solid knowledge of music theory, which would assist me through my later compositions. My experience with music DAWâ€™s stems back to August 2021, where I began recording guitar parts. With this came chopping up drum loops to match guitar parts and eventually designing my own drum sounds and loops electronically to form better suited rhythm and bridges to aid my compositions. Through this short introduction of sound design I began to play around with manipulating synthesizers. This drew my attention to not only the rhythm of the track, but also the texture and timbre of the MIDI instruments. In particular, how to encapsulate the listener with small details in sound design, along with mixing and mastering decisions. From September-December 2021 I completed a music production course. With this I gained a strong base knowledge of recording techniques, writing and building melodies. I learnt how different microphones and placements of them can affect recordings. From this I also gained a solid studio workflow, being as efficient as I can with the time given.

 <h3> Computing And Technology</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  My interest in computing began with computer architecture. This is something we have studied in-depth during my Computer Science and Maths foundation year. Assessing the storage and process of data from the point a computer starts up to when loading a program. Having skills in Python, HTML and CSS, coding small games and building websites(including this page) with these languages bettered my understanding of how binary is processed. I first started to learn Python in January 2022, where I completed an 8 week course on programming, learning how to effectively organize my code and understanding the basics of the language.This led me to pursue my foundation year as I found an interest in it. In particular the problem solving aspect of this. It can be brought back to music mixing and mastering with the effort and thought involved in molding different elements of a track to fit together. For instance, panning each instrument correctly and using tools such as compression and saturation to thicken a sound and attenuate it to the right degree, so that it sits in the track comfortably. Having learnt about electrics and waves during my Physics A-level, I have a grasp on the characteristics of sound waves and how they can be formed by electrical impulses causing oscillations consequently vibrating the air molecules, a process that can be manipulated with various hardware. I also understand how acoustics can be affected by a multitude of factors, this knowledge I apply when doing live recordings.
